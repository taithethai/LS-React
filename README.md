## Project Description

![alt tag](/assets/twitter.png)

  * Run `npm i -g create-react-app` to install the React app generator.
  * Run `create-react-app twitter` to create your starter application.
  * Create a file called `application-data.js` in `/src` and paste the JS shown below into that file.  This is the data that you will use to render your tweet and profile components.
  * Build out your application to roughly match the screenshot shown above.
  * Focus less on exact styling and more on the structure of your React components.
  * You will probably start with 5 main components in `App.js`.  (`NavBar`, `Banner`, `Profile`, `Stream`, and `RightColumn`)
